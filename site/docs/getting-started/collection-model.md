# Collection Model

The scraper has native performance collection and optional additional metrics.
Database activity uses its own short sampling schedule so slower SQL, plan, and
additional-metric queries cannot delay activity observations.

The Oracle ASH collector is **DISABLED by default**.   
Enabling it requires that **YOU verify your Oracle Diagnostics Pack licensing**.

## Native Performance Collection

Native performance collection is the scraper's default behavior. It does not
require a metric definition file and writes structured Oracle data to dedicated
tables:

| PostgreSQL table | Collected data |
| --- | --- |
| `oracle_sql_samples` | `GV$SQLSTATS` counters by SQL ID, including executions, CPU, elapsed time, and I/O |
| `oracle_sql_texts` | Complete SQL text, stored once per source database and SQL ID |
| `oracle_sql_plans` | Cached `GV$SQL_PLAN` operations, stored once per cursor-plan identity |
| `oracle_session_samples` | Current sessions, SQL, waits, modules, programs, and machines |
| `oracle_blocking_session_samples` | Waiter and blocker relationships |
| `oracle_database_activity_samples` | Activity observations from `GV$SESSION` by default, or explicitly enabled Oracle ASH |

The default `session` activity source polls active foreground sessions from
`GV$SESSION`. Every stored observation records `sample_source = SESSION` and
the duration represented by that observation. This supports AAS, wait-class,
wait-event, SQL, session, module, service, and blocking analysis without
querying Oracle ASH.

The optional `ash` source reads `GV$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY` and stores
`sample_source = ASH`. It adds Oracle's internal sample timing and ASH-only
details such as the active plan hash and plan line. The two sources are never
silently substituted: dashboards expose the source stored with each row.

Session sampling cannot observe SQL that starts and finishes between polls.
The frequent `GV$SQLSTATS` collector complements it for short, frequently
executed statements. PostgreSQL derives changes between cumulative counter
snapshots, so a statement executing thousands of times per minute remains
visible even when no session poll catches its 50-millisecond executions. An
activity observation should not be interpreted as an exact trace of every
execution.

The included Grafana dashboards query these tables directly. They do not query
`oracle_metric_samples`.

Use native collectors for diagnostic entities with many changing dimensions,
including SQL IDs, child cursors, plan hashes, sessions, blocking chains, wait
events, SQL text, modules, programs, and machines. Typed columns make these
values easier to index, aggregate, filter, and evolve than a generic label
document.

SQL statistics, SQL text, and execution plans have different collection and storage lifecycles.
`oracle_sql_samples` is a daily partitioned fact table and does not duplicate
the statement text in every sample. Its frequent query reads recently active
rows from `GV$SQLSTATS`, which Oracle provides as a SQL-ID-level statistics
view. The slower bounded detail pass reads `SQL_FULLTEXT` and child cursor keys
from `GV$SQL`. `oracle_sql_texts` is a non-partitioned
lookup table keyed by `(source_database, sql_id)` and stores Oracle
`SQL_FULLTEXT`, first-seen, last-text-seen, and last-reference timestamps.
Dashboards join the tables logically; PostgreSQL foreign keys are intentionally
not used because session and activity samples may observe SQL IDs that are not
present in the top-SQL collection.

`oracle_sql_plans` is another non-partitioned lookup table. Each row represents
one operation in a cached cursor plan, keyed by source database, instance, SQL
ID, child number, plan hash, and plan line ID. The scraper considers a bounded
top-N candidate set on a slower interval and avoids querying plans already
collected while they remain active candidates. The stored cardinality, cost,
bytes, and predicate values are optimizer estimates; runtime `ALLSTATS` data is
not enabled or collected.

When PostgreSQL retention is enabled, SQL text and plan operations are deleted
only after their last known reference is older than the oldest retained daily
partition. When retention is disabled, lookup-table cleanup is also disabled.

## Additional Metrics

Additional metrics are optional SQL-derived measurements loaded from TOML or
YAML definition files:

```yaml
metrics:
  scrapeInterval: 15s
  definitions:
    - /etc/oracledb-monitor/oracle-operational-metrics.toml
    - /etc/oracledb-monitor/application-metrics.toml
```

Each numeric result is stored as a row in:

```text
oracle_metric_samples
```

No additional metrics are collected when `metrics.definitions` is empty or
omitted. Native performance collection continues normally.

The project supplies `oracle-operational-metrics.toml` as an optional starting
pack. It contains bounded operational measurements such as session counts,
resource limits, ASM capacity, activity counters, process counts, wait-class
time, tablespace usage, selected database parameters, platform information,
and cache hit ratios. It is not an embedded fallback and is used only when its
path is listed under `metrics.definitions`.

## Choosing A Storage Model

Use `oracle_metric_samples` when the result is naturally a numeric measurement
with a bounded set of dimensions. Examples include tablespace utilization by
tablespace, process counts by instance, or resource limits by resource name.

Use a dedicated collector and typed table when rows identify diagnostic
entities, dimensions grow without a practical bound, or dashboards need to
query many attributes efficiently. Examples include every SQL ID, SQL text,
session, cursor, execution plan, object, or blocking relationship.

PostgreSQL avoids a Prometheus time-series label explosion, but it does not make
cardinality free. Every unique label combination still creates stored rows, and
unbounded JSON labels increase storage, indexing, retention, and dashboard
costs. Estimate rows per collection cycle and retention before enabling a
medium- or high-cardinality definition.

See [Additional Metrics](../configuration/additional-metrics.md) for the file
schema, ordered override behavior, and examples.
