# Release Notes

List of upcoming and historic changes to the scraper.

### Next, TBD

- Rank bounded SQL text and plan candidates by elapsed-time deltas accumulated
  from frequent `GV$SQLSTATS` samples instead of cumulative cursor lifetime,
  combining RAC instances and plan hashes by SQL ID.
- Split SQL troubleshooting into a four-category Oracle SQL Performance
  overview and a linked Oracle SQL Top Consumers dashboard with top-20 ranking,
  detailed time, workload and I/O graphs with fixed series colors, full SQL
  text, and cached plans.
- Serialize additional metric queries per database to prevent simultaneous OCI
  connection creation when pooled connections reach their maximum lifetime.
- Document `ORA_SDTZ` in the systemd service configuration so godror sessions
  can use the Oracle database server time zone.
- Remove redundant source-database columns from Grafana table panels while
  retaining the dashboard-level database filters and internal query joins.
- Make Oracle ASH collection explicitly opt-in and default activity analytics
  to independent two-second `GV$SESSION` sampling. Persist the activity source
  and represented duration, use duration-weighted AAS calculations, and warn
  operators that enabling ASH requires them to verify Diagnostics Pack
  licensing.
- Move frequent SQL counter collection to recently active `GV$SQLSTATS` rows so
  short, high-frequency statements remain diagnosable without appearing in a
  session sample. Fetch `SQL_FULLTEXT` and child-plan identities only through
  the bounded, slower SQL detail pass.
- Add bounded, interval-controlled `GV$SQL_PLAN` collection for top SQL cursors,
  deduplicate plan operations in `oracle_sql_plans`, retain plans while they are
  referenced by SQL samples, and expose selected execution plans in the Oracle
  SQL Performance dashboard.
- Replace `metrics.default` and `metrics.custom` with one optional ordered
  `metrics.definitions` list. Native SQL, session, blocking, and DAH collection
  now runs without any generic metric definition file.
- Rename the supplied metric pack from `default-metrics.*` to
  `oracle-operational-metrics.*`, stop embedding it as a fallback, and remove
  its duplicated high-cardinality `top_sql` definition.
- Document the boundary between native typed performance collectors and
  additional SQL-derived metrics stored in `oracle_metric_samples`, including
  PostgreSQL cardinality and retention considerations.
- Normalize Oracle SQL text into `oracle_sql_texts`, collect complete
  `SQL_FULLTEXT` once per source database and SQL ID, and expire unreferenced
  text with the global PostgreSQL retention policy. The SQL Performance
  dashboard keeps short previews and adds a full-width selected-SQL text panel.
- Rename the project runtime to scraper terminology, including Go types, the default binary name, Docker targets, sample manifests, and active documentation.
- Replace the Prometheus scrape endpoint runtime with scheduled Oracle metric collection that writes neutral metric samples to PostgreSQL using batched `COPY` inserts.
- Add PostgreSQL output configuration, schema auto-migration for scrape summaries and metric samples, and example configuration entries.
- Remove Prometheus collector, logging, web toolkit, and client dependencies from the scraper code.
- Add PostgreSQL to the Docker Compose test stack and configure the scraper examples to write to it.
- Build the Docker Compose scraper service from the local fork image instead of Oracle's published Prometheus endpoint image.
- Add direct Oracle performance scraping for `GV$SQL`, `GV$SESSION`, and blocking sessions, with dedicated PostgreSQL tables and a starter Grafana dashboard backed by PostgreSQL.
- Add PostgreSQL Grafana dashboard filters and live `SQL_ID` panels for currently active Oracle sessions.
- Preserve available Oracle performance samples when one of the SQL, session, or blocking-session queries fails.
- Document the Oracle PDB scope of monitoring users and the additional `GV_$SQL` permission required for SQL performance samples.
- Pass explicit Go build arguments through the local Compose image build for compatibility with Podman builds.
- Add PostgreSQL activity-history storage and a dedicated DAH Grafana dashboard.
- Split Docker builds into a reusable `build-deps` stage and wire the local compose build to reuse that dependency image cache.
- Include collected Database Activity History samples in the aggregated PostgreSQL write payload.
- Replace the scrape-summary parent table with daily range-partitioned PostgreSQL sample tables and create partitions on demand before writing samples.
- Add a single PostgreSQL sample retention setting that drops expired daily partitions across all sample tables.
- Add per-database `connMaxIdleTime` for Oracle connections so idle pooled sessions can be recycled before database profile `IDLE_TIME` kills them.
- Remove the duplicated raw JSON payload from `oracle_metric_samples` to reduce PostgreSQL storage usage.
- Remove DAH-overlapping activity history panels from the Oracle DB Performance Grafana dashboard.
- Add DAH Grafana drilldowns for top wait events and module/program activity.
- Change the DAH SQL_ID activity panel to a stacked top-SQL timeline using interval buckets and total/max legend values.
- Add a PostgreSQL-backed Oracle SQL Performance Grafana dashboard for high-cardinality SQL diagnostics.
- Refactor the Oracle DB Performance Grafana dashboard into a current sessions and blocking dashboard.
